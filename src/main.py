#To do:
# -Test the application on real time fotos to find the best performant configuration of Recor_lenght and CAPTURE_INTERVAL. While doing this look for posible improvements to the parking lot class to enhance accuaracy. 
# - To look for the best performant configuration is only needed to change the RECORD_LENGHT global variable, the CAPTURE_INTERVAL will be automatically modified, so the report latency is always 15 min.
# - Posible improvements can be: Sometimes two detections in the same Frame are matched with the same parking spot. Right now the 2 detections are count as a duplicate of the same instace,
# so the system keeps only the better scoring detection and the other one is disregarded. But sometimes this detections are actually two different instances in two different spots close to each other, 
# so one detection is going missed. This can be improve by checking the score of the disregarded detection and if is confiable add this detection to the second best ioU matching parking spot, what is highly probably the correct spot 
# - Database improvemnt: Change the database to one that supports web applications, and change the databse structur. Currently only occupied spots are store in the database, this works with local database and the actual local UI. 
# But itÂ´ll be better and more complete to save the hole parking spots list in the database. This is easy to do, but the the data analysis methods will need to properly modified.
# - Web dashboard: With a proper database, a web UI can be implementet without changing the system pipeline. The changes will be regarding the database insert and retrive methods, 
# and off course the data analisis methods that are based in the data base information and structur
